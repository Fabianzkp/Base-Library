# Base-Library
The project addresses the need for a streamlined, centralized platform for digital reading. Base Library provides a clean, user-friendly interface for discovering and managing books. It solves the problem of difficult navigation and loss of data by allowing users to search, categorize, and "save" their favorite books in one responsive location.
